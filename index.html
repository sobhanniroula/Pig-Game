1. The game has 2 players, playing in rounds. <br>
2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his CURRENT score. <br>
3. BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn. <br>
4. The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After that, it's the next player's turn. <br>
5. The first player to reach 100 points on GLOBAL score wins the game. <br> </p>
